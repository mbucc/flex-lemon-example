lemon-parser-tutorial

	Lemon (http://www.hwaci.com/sw/lemon/) is a yacc replacement that
	is part the SQLite source tree. It's uses a different grammar than
	yacc, is thread-safe, and is designed to run inside long-running
	processes (i.e. not leak).

	example](https://github.com/bskari/lemon-parser-tutorial) by
